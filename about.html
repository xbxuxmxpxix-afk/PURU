        <p>
            <B>I’m a student with a deep passion for creating, building, and learning every single day.
               From writing my first line of code to exploring<BR> complex web technologies, coding has become more than a skill for me — it’s my language of expression.
               I enjoy turning ideas into<BR> interactive and meaningful digital experiences.
               Sports also play a big role in my life; they keep me energetic, focused, and driven to<BR> push my limits.
               The blend of coding and sports has shaped my discipline, creativity, and problem-solving mindset.
               I’m constantly<BR> experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and projects to sharpen my abilities.
               Every bug I fix and every feature I build brings me<BR> one step closer to my goal.
               My dream is to become a full-time web developer and contribute to the world with impactful digital solutions.<BR>
               I believe learning never stops, and I’m always excited to grow with every challenge I take on.
               This website is a small reflection of my journey — a place where I combine curiosity, passion, and hard work.
               Welcome to my space, and thank you for being a part of my journey.<BR><BR>
               Let’s build, learn, and grow together.</B>
